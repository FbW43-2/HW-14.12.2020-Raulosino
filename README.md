# Palindrome Challenge
What is Palindrome?
"A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which reads the same 
backward as forward, such as madam, racecar."-- Wikipedia
PROBLEM:
1- Write a function that controls whether its argument is a palindrome (return true) or not (return false).
2- Rewrite the function with function expression.
3- Instead of the argument variable, use rewrite your function (and expression) with a global variable.
